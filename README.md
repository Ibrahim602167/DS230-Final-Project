# Machine Learning Project: Classification and Regression of User Purchasing Behavior

Project Overview: This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for classification and regression tasks using user purchasing behavior data. The goal is to predict product reordering behavior (classification) and estimate the number of days remaining until the next order (regression) by following an integrated machine learning path.

Project Structure: The project consists of several books and folders, including: data files, exploratory analysis books, model training and evaluation books, visualization outputs, and a final report (PDF file). This structure ensures clarity, reproducibility, and ease of evaluation.

Task Descriptions: Task A - Classification: This task aims to predict whether a user will reorder a product based on previous purchase data. Task B - Regression: This task aims to predict the number of days remaining until the user places their next order.

Methodology: The project follows these key steps: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, classification and regression model development, hyperparameter adjustment and cross-validation, model comparison, interpretability and analysis using SHAP, robustness and endurance testing, decision limits, and required visualizations and graphs.

Evaluation Criteria: Classification models were evaluated using ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall AUC. Regression models were evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE).

Final Report: The final report, available in PDF format, provides a detailed explanation of the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.
