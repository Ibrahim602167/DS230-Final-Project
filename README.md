# DS230-Final-Project
Machine Learning Project
Classification and Regression on User Purchase Behavior

Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks using user purchase behavior data.
The goal is to predict product reordering behavior (classification) and estimate the number of days until the next order (regression) by following a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple notebooks and folders that include:
Data files
Exploratory analysis notebooks
Model training and evaluation notebooks
Visualization outputs
Final report (PDF)
This structure ensures clarity, reproducibility, and ease of evaluation.

Tasks Description
Task A – Classification
The objective of this task is to predict whether a product will be reordered by a user based on historical purchase data.
Task B – Regression
The objective of this task is to predict the number of days until the user places the next order.

Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Classification and Regression Model Preparation
Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation
Model Comparison
Explainability and Interpretability using SHAP
Robustness and Stress Testing
Decision Boundaries Visualization
Required Visualizations and Plots

Evaluation Metrics
Classification models were evaluated using ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall AUC.
Regression models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Final Report
A detailed explanation of the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions is provided in the final PDF report.
